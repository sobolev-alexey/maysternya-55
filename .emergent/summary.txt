<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a WordPress website that is an exact replica of a provided Figma design.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Figma to WordPress:** Convert all pages from the Figma file into a WordPress website. (Figma URL: https://www.figma.com/proto/q0oDW4R0ke3m3rT9g0EFRJ/Maysternya-55-%E2%80%93-Design?node-id=0-1)
2.  **Responsive Layout:** Every page must have a responsive layout, switching between mobile and desktop versions based on viewport width.
3.  **Navigation:** Implement the navigation menu as designed in the Navigation page of the Figma file.
4.  **Content Management:** Content sections should be clearly marked so that content creators can easily modify content and replace images within WordPress.
5.  **Pixel-Perfect Design:** The theme's styling (fonts, colors, layout, spacing, borders) must strictly match the Figma design for all sections, including the header and footer.
6.  **Custom Fonts & Assets:** The theme must use the provided custom fonts (, ) and logo.
7.  **Content Import:** Create WordPress import files () for pages, starting with the Home page, using dummy text and placeholder images.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A WordPress theme named  has been created in the  directory. The theme includes multiple PHP templates, CSS files for layout and responsiveness, a  directory, and a  directory containing the user-provided fonts. An XML file for importing the home page content exists in . The theme has been iterated upon twice but still fails to accurately match the user's Figma design, particularly for the home page.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the process of a major overhaul of the theme's CSS and PHP templates to address detailed user feedback about styling discrepancies on the front page. It had just rewritten the CSS files (, , ), the header and footer templates (, ), and the front page template (). The immediate next step was to create SVG files for the language selector flags (German and Ukrainian).
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** NA. The current task is file generation. The user is performing manual testing by importing the theme and content into their own WordPress environment.
- **User Testing Done:** N (User has tested previous versions and provided feedback, but has not tested the current in-progress version.)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: (P0)** The front page implementation does not match the Figma design.
  - **Description:** The user provided a detailed list of styling and layout errors in message #120, including:
    - **Projects Section:** Incorrect subtitle, wrong border color, non-square images, incorrect text placement (should be overlaid on the image), and missing pointer cursor on project links.
    - **Events Section:** Incorrect 3-column layout on desktop.
    - **About Us Section:** Incorrect layout (should be a large image with centered text on top and a specific text structure below).
    - **Header & Footer:** Incorrect styling, wrong navigation items, and a missing language selector.
  - **Attempted fixes:** The agent has created the theme and updated it twice. The last set of actions (rewriting CSS and PHP files) was a direct attempt to fix this, but it is not yet complete.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  Create SVG files for the German and Ukrainian flags as intended.
    2.  Place the new SVG files in the theme's image/asset directory.
    3.  Ensure the newly rewritten  correctly implements the language selector with flags.
    4.  Verify that  and its associated CSS () now correctly render all sections (Projects, Events, About Us) as per the user's detailed feedback.
    5.  Package the fully updated theme into a new  file.
    6.  Update the  file to ensure its content structure is compatible with the new theme layout.
    7.  Package the XML file into a new import archive.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will resolve the user's primary complaint and bring the home page design in line with the Figma specification, which is the core requirement of the project.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (The user will test by importing the generated theme zip file).
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Create language flag SVGs (P0)**
  - **Description:** The agent was about to create SVG files for the German and Ukrainian flags to be used in the header's language selector.
  - **Where to resume:** Use a tool or command to generate the two SVG files.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The header's language selector will have the required visual assets.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **(P0)** Create a new, final zip archive of the  after all current fixes are implemented.
  - **(P0)** Create a new zip archive containing the updated  import file.
  - **(P1)** Create WordPress import files (.xml) for all other pages identified from the Figma prototype (e.g., Founder Page, History, International Projects, Team, Manifesto, Performances, Educational Projects).
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **(P2)** Ensure all 35 pages/states from the Figma file are correctly implemented as either WordPress page templates or importable content.

**Completed work in this session**
- Analyzed the multi-page Figma prototype to understand desktop and mobile designs.
- Correctly pivoted from the initial boilerplate (React/FastAPI) to a WordPress theme development task.
- Created the file structure for a WordPress theme ().
- Created multiple PHP template files (, , , , , , etc.).
- Integrated user-provided custom fonts (, ) and a logo into the theme.
- Generated a WordPress XML import file for the home page content.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The agent is actively working on the only major reported issue.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**
The project consists of a standard WordPress theme located at .


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **WordPress Theme Development:** Creating a custom theme from scratch using PHP, CSS, and JS.
-   **PHP:** Used for server-side logic and templating in WordPress.
-   **CSS:** Used for styling, including modern features like CSS variables and Flexbox/Grid for responsive layouts.
-   **Responsive Design:** Using media queries to adapt the layout for mobile and desktop viewports.
-   **Figma Analysis:** Interpreting design specifications (layout, typography, assets) from a Figma prototype.
-   **XML:** Creating a WordPress eXtended RSS (WXR) file for content import.

**key DB schema**
N/A (The agent is not directly interacting with the database; it is creating files for a standard WordPress installation).

**changes in tech stack**
The agent correctly identified that the user's request for a WordPress site meant abandoning the default React/FastAPI boilerplate and starting a new WordPress theme from scratch.

**All files**
-   All files under : These constitute the WordPress theme that needs to be installed on the user's site.
-   : This file contains the dummy content for the home page, to be imported using the WordPress Importer plugin.
-   : The zipped archive of the theme for easy installation.
-   : The zipped archive of the import file.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user has a very high standard for design accuracy and requires a pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma mockups. Previous attempts failed due to a lack of attention to detail.
-   You must meticulously follow the latest feedback from the user (message #120) to fix the home page. Do not assume previous code is correct.
-   The end goal is a downloadable zip archive of the WordPress theme () and a separate archive for the content import file ().
-   The project is **not** a React/FastAPI application. All work should be focused on the WordPress theme in the  directory.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User (Msg 81):** Requested creation of the Home Page as a WordPress import file, providing screenshots and instructions for placeholders.
2.  **User (Msg 102):** Provided detailed feedback that the first version was not accurate. Requested stricter adherence to design, including square images, text overlays, correct fonts/logo, and updated header/footer. Provided font files and a logo.
3.  **User (Msg 120):** Provided another round of highly specific feedback, indicating the second version of the home page is still incorrect. Listed numerous errors in the Projects, Events, About Us, Header, and Footer sections. This is the **most important pending message** to address.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The primary deliverable (the WordPress theme) does not currently meet the user's explicit design requirements.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** N/A
-   **Known regressions:** The styling and layout of the home page have been identified as incorrect multiple times.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent initially did not process all 35 pages of the Figma file and had to be reminded by the user. The main failure, however, has been in the *quality* of execution, specifically the inability to accurately translate the Figma design into CSS and PHP code despite multiple attempts.</analysis>
